### Mobile Customer Churn

This is a project for unit COMP6200 that I took as part of my postgraduate study in Business Analytics at Macquarie Univeristy.

This project involves analysing data on Mobile Customer Churn (Churn is where a customer leaves the mobile provider) and building a simple predictive model to predict churn from available features.

The data was generated by Hume Winzar at Macquarie based on a real dataset provided by Optus. The data is simulated but the variables are the same. Cautious taht the real relationships in this data may not have been preserved through the simulation. The data is provided in file MobileCustomerChurn.csv and column headings are defined in a file MobileChurnDataDictionary.csv (in the files folder).

The high level goal in this notebook is to try to build and evaluate a predictive model for churn - predict the value of the CHURN_IND field in the data from some of the other fields. Note that the three RECON fields should not be used as they indicate whether the customer reconnected after having churned.
